I collaborated with Joseph Devito and used the in class activites from Module 20 to build my code. 

Credit Analysis Report: 

1. Overview: Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this credit risk analysis is to assess the performance of a machine learning model designed to predict credit risk in loan applications. The model aims to assist the company in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals, distinguishing between healthy and high-risk loans. 

2. Model Performance Metrics:

- Accuracy: 99%
- Precision (Class 0 - Healthy Loan): 100%
- Precision (Class 1 - High-Risk Loan): 84%
- Recall (Class 0 - Healthy Loan): 99%
- Recall (Class 1 - High-Risk Loan): 94%

  
3. Results Summary:

Class 0 (Healthy Loan):

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are excellent (100%, 99%, 100% respectively).
The model accurately identifies healthy loans, minimizing false positives.

Class 1 (High-Risk Loan):

While the model demonstrates good performance, there is room for improvement in precision (84%).
Recall is high (94%), indicating effective identification of actual high-risk loans.

4. Recommendation and Justification:

The machine learning model shows remarkable accuracy and precision, especially in predicting healthy loans. It excels in minimizing false positives, crucial for ensuring that sound loans are not mistakenly flagged. While precision for high-risk loans could be improved, the overall performance, including a 94% recall for high-risk loans, is commendable.

Justification for Recommendation:

Strengths:

High accuracy and precision for healthy loans ensure a robust screening process, protecting the company from unnecessary risk.
Strong recall for high-risk loans indicates the model's effectiveness in identifying potential problematic cases.

Areas for Improvement:

Focus on enhancing precision for high-risk loans to further reduce false positives and improve the overall risk assessment.

Conclusion:

Considering the model's exceptional performance in identifying healthy loans and its solid overall metrics, we recommend its adoption for use by the company. Continued monitoring and periodic model updates can address potential refinements, particularly in increasing precision for high-risk loans. The model stands as a valuable tool to streamline and enhance the credit evaluation process, contributing to more informed decision-making and risk management within the company.
